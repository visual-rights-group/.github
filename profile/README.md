## Visual Rights Group

Fair remuneration for your work should be obvious. Yet all too often that doesn’t happen. Images are constantly being downloaded from the Internet to be uploaded again elsewhere without permission and without compensation for the author. Yet these images are often created by a professional photographer who then loses income as a result. That’s where Visual Rights Group comes in.

Visual Rights Group provides that fair compensation, because fair p(l)ay is important. We do this on one hand by detecting and rectifying infringements in a clear, transparent way. We contact the infringer and clearly explain the infringement, how we operate and what the costs are. On the other hand, we also want to focus on prevention by informing them about the legal way to use visual content online.
